# React Navigation 5
# Stack Navigation
# Moving between screens and passing parameters to routes

## STEP 1: Installing necessary dependencies
### 1. Install these dependencies for using Navigation
```
npm install --save @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install --save react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```
### 2. Install these dependencies for using Typescript
```
npm install --save @types/react @types/react-native
```
## STEP 2: Determining type 'RootStackParamList'
This type is used to check type of routes params when we pass params to routes or use them in one screen\
We will use this type for many steps after
## STEP 3: Determining type 'NavigationProp', 'RouteProp' for type checking for every screen you have
## STEP 4: Creating screens
## STEP 5: Moving between screens
## STEP 6: Passing parameters to routes and get parameters
